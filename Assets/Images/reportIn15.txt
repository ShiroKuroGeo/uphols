Good morning, everyone. I am George Alfeser Inoc, and I am going to report
on computer operation and the understanding of how computers work.
Computer operation is to execute tasks and functions.
These operations are the core functions that enable
computer to process data, run applications, and provide output to users.


Computer operations are vital for productivity and data management.
communication, automation, problem solving, and innovation

So what is a computer? A computer is an electronic device that processes
store and manipulate data and calculations, including on phones, laptops, calculators, and many more.

There are eight primary functions, summarized as follows:
The input where a computer receives data and commands from a user, such as a keyboard, mouse, touchpad, or touchscreen
and voice recognition system.
The CPU, or central processing unit, is where computers perform complex calculations and execute instructions.
and manage the flow of data within the computer system.
The storage where computers store vast amounts of data, including files, documents, and many more
the data that you stored temporarily in random access memory, RAM, or on an HDD or SSD
The output is where computers can provide information and results to users through output devices such as monitors, printers, speakers, and displays.
Communication: Where a computer connects to a network or the internet, that allows the user to communicate with others through sending and receiving
Automation is where computers can automate repetitive tasks by executing predefined instructions, minimizing errors and manual effort.
and increases efficiency.
Information processing is where computers are capable of processing and analyzing volumes of data.
and lastly, multimedia, where computers handle multimedia content, including audio, video, and graphics.

Hardware and Software Comparison: These two are fundamental components of a computer system.

So what are the differences between hardware and software?
hardware hasÂ 
Physical components where you can touch these parts, such as the keyboard, mouse, monitor, and many more
the fixed and static, where you can't change its function unless physically modified or replaced.
It is essential for operation, so without hardware components like the CPU and motherboard, a computer cannot function.
Physical limitations such as the speed of the process, storage capacity, and connectivity
Examples of hardware components include the motherboard, graphics card, mouse, and power supply.

Meanwhile, software has
programs and instructions that tell hardware what to do
a dynamic and modifiable system that can be modified, updated, and replaced without physical hardware, like, for example, installing
new application update and operating system add feature to a computer or fixing bug
Hardware is dependent on hardware, so without hardware, software cannot provide functionality; the hardware processes the software instructions to perform tasks.
Scalability developers create software to run on a wide range of hardware configurations, from personal computers to phones.
